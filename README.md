<h1 align="center">Lingerer Map Project</h1>

Website: [Lingerer](https://lingerer.cn)

> `Lingerer Map` is an open-source and free GIS application template designed to provide a fast, scalable, and professional development experience for most GIS developers.

Currently, this project uses the following frameworks:
- Vite 5
- Vue 3
- Pinia
- Mapbox GL JS 3.6

> âœ¨ Note: Our goal is to build a set of framework-agnostic general GIS application template products to provide the design and implementation of common GIS functions in the field of common GIS, which should work well in any map SDK, but currently we use Mapbox to verify product functionality.
